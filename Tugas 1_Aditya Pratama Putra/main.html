        <p class="isi"><b class="es">S</b>trawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that 
            are seed- studded. They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus Fragaria of the 
            rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed foliage, and runners. They originate 
            all through the north temperate zones.<br><br>They are the most famous and trendiest fruits 
            in the planet (Roger). There are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, 
            size, and feel; all of which have similar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy tissue with 
            yellow seeds shooting the surface, petite, royal, leafy green lids, and stalk that embellish 
            their crowns (WHFoods). Below is picture of the strawberry fruit.

        <h2 id="Detailed_history">Detailed History</h2>
        <p class="isi">The word strawberry is coined from 'strewn" berries about the plants and thus 
            the "strewn berry" finally turned into "Strawberry" (Roger). They are not actual fruits 
            or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant. The seeds are on the external 
            surface, rather than the internal berry. There are around 200 seeds for each berry. They 
            are low in calories and are non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 
            and potassium (Roger).<br> <br> Over the years they have been utilized as medications for 
            ailments like, stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries were 
            served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth, and excellence. The most 
            well-known communal intake of strawberries is at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and 
            cream are eaten by very well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).
